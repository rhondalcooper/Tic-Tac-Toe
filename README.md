# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the project for the Cisco Skills for All Python Essentials Course
Your task is to write a simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user. To make it all easier for you, we've decided to simplify the game. Here are our assumptions:

The computer (i.e., your program) should play the game using 'X's;
The user (e.g., you) should play the game using 'O's;
The first move belongs to the computer − it always puts its first  'X' in the middle of the board;
All the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1 
The user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose − the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 
0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;
The program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: 
The game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins;
The computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
Don't implement any form of artificial intelligence − a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.
